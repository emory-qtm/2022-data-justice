    "\n",
    "An Intelligence Quotient, or IQ, is a score resulting from a test designed to assess human intelligence. Over the past 100 years, it has been one of the most controversial and widely studied psychometrics. IQ scores have been used as a basis for eugenics programs, both in the US and Nazi Germany, and they are still used by the US army to determine who to accept/deny. The SAT, even, was originally an IQ test for high schoolers that was developed in part by a eugenicist, Carl Brigham, who believed it would prove white racial superiority. One of the big questions is what IQ tests actually assess.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> 2. Controversial Theories of IQ Differences and Human Evolution <a name=\"Recent_IQ_Studies\"></a></h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our notebook today is based on a paper that was written specifically to **debunk** several previous papers, Kanazawa 2008, Templer 2008, and Templer and Arikawa 2006.\n",
    "\n",
    "These papers, in summary, claimed that they \"found empirical support for evolutionary theories of race differences in intelligence by **correlating estimates of national IQ with reproductive strategies, temperature, and geographic distance from Africa**.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these three correlations they claimed to have found were based on corresponding **evolutionary theories of intelligence**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Higher general intelligence evolved to meet the challenge of surviving in colder and more demanding climates\" (Lynn, 1991, 2006)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"General intelligence evolved in response to new environmental challenges that didn't exist in the EEA\" (EEA, which stands for Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness, and in this context, refers to Sub-Saharan Africa in the late Pleistocene, the time when and place where our species evolved) (Kanazawa, 2004)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"The three major human races (i.e., Whites, Blacks, and Asians) differ in levels of intelligence because of different evolved reproductive strategies.\" (Rushton, 2000)\n",
    "\n",
    "Kanazawa (2008) focused on theories 1 and 2; Templer (2008) focused on theory 3; Templer and Arikawa (2006) focused on theory 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wicherts, Borsboom, and Dolan, found errors in the **methodologies** of each of the above papers. While these are not essential to what we will be learning in the notebook today, they are summarized below and are worth reading to understand some of the biases shown by authors of the criticized papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <h4> Some Basic Issues with the Methodologies of the papers under scrutiny <a name=\"paper_methodology_errors\"></a> </h4>\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The following noted issues constitute a **Part 1** of the paper this notebook was based on.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 1. Authors of the criticized papers ignore the controversy over whether IQ reflects intelligence, and assume that national IQ scores reflect general intelligence.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2. They assume race is a biologically meaningful construct, and that nations may differ in terms of racially dominant groups. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> 3. They base their hypotheses on the \"Out of Africa\" hypothesis. Their evolutionary hypotheses are based on events that took place 60-100 thousand years ago, but the data they use to test their hypotheses were gathered in the 20th century. Even during the 20th century, average IQ, for example, has changed within many populations. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> 4. Climate, which they claim plays a role in selection for intelligence, has changed over that period, so using current climate data is uninformative.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 5. The calculation of distance from sub-Saharan Africa is flawed, both geometrically, and practically, when considering people have traveled the distance on foot; plus, distance is sometimes meaningless when it comes to the similarities and differences of different habitats.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 6. Though these papers suggest populations are historically distinct, instead of using countries with mostly indigenous inhabitants, they used countries that are mostly made of the descendants of relatively recent migrants (like the US and Australia).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many **scientific questions** related to this topic that we will not be addressing in this notebook; some of them we did already mention in class, and they are good to keep in mind as we proceed. As Wicherts et al. note: \"our criticisms concern the evidential force of data on national IQs with respect to evolutionary theories of intelligence, rather than the truth of these evolutionary theories per se\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will consider **errors in the statistical analysis** performed by each of the abovementioned papers, as discussed by Wicherts et al. They show that in fact, national IQ's are **strongly confounded** with the current developmental status of countries, as measured by variables like health, family size, education, and urbanization. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea to consider these variables comes from an effect described in 1987 by James Flynn: he found that countries around the world experienced a significant leap in IQ scores within one generation. This change was linked to the progress countries have seen during the 20th century in different aspects of health and education. Throughout this unit we discussed evidence of such environmental effects on performance in IQ tests, so in terms of causality, this connection makes a lot of sense. "
