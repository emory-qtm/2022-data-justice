    "Facial recognition systems are not a new technology. In fact, they gained popularity (in the U.S.) almost thirty years ago after the U.S. military created a facial recognition technology program (FERET). Outside of the military, facial recognition saw its first uses in DMV offices trying to stop people from obtaining multiple id's under different names. However, local and government law enforcement agencies quickly realized the potential of its applications, and today, nearly every state's police department uses facial recognition systems in some ways. In [some cases](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6587265-Shoesshoplifting-Redacted.html), it is the only evidence used to arrest suspects. \n",
    "\n",
    "This presents a problem for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that facial recogntion models don't work very well on certain types of faces, as we discussed in the last class. Today, we're going to take a more techincal view into how facial recognition models work, and per the Buolamwini and Gebru paper, how also they don't work. "

    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning** (ML) - Let's start with the basics. Machine learning is generally defined as an iterative (multi-step) algorithm that \"learns\" patterns from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data** - This is an admittedly loose definition, but I like to define data broadly, as any type of information that has been systematically collected. A **dataset** is a collection of these data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Labeled data** - This describes data from a dataset in which all of the components have been given a metadata label--in other words, a value that answers a question. One example of a labeled dataset would be one of photos in which each photo has either the label \"outside\" or \"inside\" attached, answering the question of whether the photo was taken inside or outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unlabeled data** - This describes data from a dataset in which the components are presented with no metadata labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised Machine Learning** - Learning patterns by training with a labeled data set. Imagine a model that learns to predict whether a photo from our earlier dataset was inside or outside. It is much easier to train a model to do this if our data is labeled! That way we can tell it when it has predicted correctly and when it has failed, and it can make updates accordingly.\n",
